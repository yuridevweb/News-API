# NC-News API
Welcome to my back-end project at Northcoders. News API serving up a range of random data on a number of available endpoints.

## Getting Started & Installation



## Setting up DB enviroments

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
